//! \brief Produces, stores, and validates superblocks.
//!
//! The quorum system enables the Gridcoin network to arrive at a consensus on
//! the daily superblocks. The legacy strategy for historical blocks follows a
//! protocol wherein nodes vote for superblocks. After switching to version 11
//! blocks, nodes create and validate superblocks from scraper convergences.
//!
//! This class is designed as a facade that provides an interface for the rest
//! of the application. It consumes information from newly-connected blocks to
//! update the superblock data for research reward calculations.
//!
//! THREAD SAFETY: The quorum system interacts closely with pointers to blocks
//! in the chain index. Always lock cs_main before calling its methods.
